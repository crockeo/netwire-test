# netwire-test

This is me messing around with
[Netwire 5](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire-5.0.0) using
[GLFW](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-0.5.2.2) and
[OpenGL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenGL) to work with my UI /
rendering respectively. Who knows, maybe at some point something fun or useful
might be in here?
